#+title: Euclidean Plane Isometry
In geometry a Euclidean Plane Isometry is an [[id:49725ab9-a608-41e4-86eb-d853e2b9ad72][Isometry]] of the Euclidean plane, or more informally,
a way of transforming the that preserves all geometric properties of the plane (e.g length).

* Formal Definition
An *isometry* of the euclidean plane is a distance-preserving transformation of the plane.
That is, it is a map \[M: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\]  such that \[\forall p,q \in \mathbb{R}^2 d(p,q) = d(M(p), M(q))\] where d
is the euclidean distance between p and q.

* Classification
There are four distinct categories of euclidean plane isometries:

** Reflections
Mirror reflections along a line.

** Translations
Shifts of the plane without rotation

** Rotations
Rotation around a point by some given angle.

** Glide Reflections
Reflecting the plane along a line and then shifting it along it.
