#+title: SSH
* Key generation and registration with Gitlab
To setup an SSH key:
1. First check if you already have a key:
   #+begin_src sh
     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   #+end_src
   If the files exists and begins with 'ssh-rsa' you can skip the next step.
2. Create a key if you do not already have one:
   #+begin_src sh
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "Comment" -b 4096
   #+end_src
   You will be prompted for where to save the key, normally in ~/.ssh.
   You will be prompted for an optional passphrase for the key.
3. Copy the key into your clipboard and paste it into Gitlab under
   Profile Picture > Edit Profile > SSH Keys.
   If Gitlab complains that the key's fingerprint is taken, it means
   that you have already added the key.
