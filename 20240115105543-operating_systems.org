#+title: Operating Systems
An operating system is comprised of a kernel and system programs running on top of it.

* Interrupts
1. In the event of an interrupt, save the processor state.
2. Execute interrupt service routine (ISR).
3. Restore processor state.

** Types
- A trap is a /software/-generated interrupt caused either by an error or a user request.
  - Examples:
    - Division by zero
    - Request from user

**  Why interrupts?
Separation of modes into user mode and kernel mode.
This is done through interrupts (a syscall).
