A symmetry is an operation on an object which leaves the object unchanged.

A picture on a 2D plane can be described as a function \[f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to F\] where F is a set of colors.
A symmetry on the picture can then be defined as a function \[\phi: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2, f(\phi(x,y)) = f(x,y), \forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}\].
