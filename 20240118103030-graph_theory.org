Consider a graph of webpages where the vertexes are pages and edges are links
between them.
Nodes are labeled i, j, k, etc.

The graph can be represented with an adjacency matrix $A_{N \times N}$  where $N$ is the
size number of vertexes and $A_{ij} = 1 \Rightarrow \exists i \rightarrow j$

The number of incoming links to a page is then $k_i^{in} \sum_{j=1}^N A_{ij}$
and the number of outgoing links is $k_i^{out} = \sum_{j=1}^N A_{ji}$
