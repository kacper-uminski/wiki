A group in mathematics is an associative [[id:af7bffa1-2194-4a6d-9053-8506df751dfe][magma]] \[(G, \star)\] with an [[id:a6b01ac4-60dd-430b-a4af-b9c7fed28d89][identity element]] \[e\],
and where every element has an inverse such that \[\forall x \in G, \exists y \in G, x \star y = y \star x = e\].
This inverse is often written as \[x^{-1}\] for any given \[x \in G\].
